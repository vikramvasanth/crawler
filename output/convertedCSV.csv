Thanks for your interest in SET Media by Conversant! Here’s the deal. You’re not just applying to some basic technology company. Rather you’re applying to a powerhouse that’s changing the face of an industry! Conversant is a new company with a 15-year heritage. We’ve invested over $1 billion to launch and lead the Age of Personalization. We offer what marketers have dreamed of for years -- a single platform that offers all the data, technology, insights and personalization it takes to make true 1:1 engagement real. The results speak for themselves -- we’re already driving an average of 5.1 million sales every day for some of the world’s most beloved brands. SET was founded by software engineers interested in machine learning and computer vision, the sciences of teaching computers to look at images and understand what they see. We applied this science to online advertising by becoming experts in online video buying, spending several years buying online video for major brands like Microsoft, Sony, and Disney.
We used the hard-won lessons from buying online video to create an entirely new way to classify the content of all addressable online videos. Our system uses machine learning and computer vision to “watch” every online video frame by frame and tell you exactly what’s in it.
We couldn’t have done any of that without our team of superstars and a culture that celebrates each one of them. Individuals matter just as much within our walls as they do in the 1:1 marketing programs we create for clients. Here’s what we believe in at Conversant: • Ownership – We’re determined to make an impact – preferably a big one – every day. • Integrity – We treat our clients, customers and co-workers with genuine respect. • Teamwork – We believe everything worthwhile is achieved through collaboration. • Innovation – The status quo bores us. Everyone is encouraged to think differently and invent relentlessly. Conversant is committed to one simple but truly exciting principle: each person is different and every person matters. This mindset fuels everything we do for our clients and for each other. We do magic for our clients and we have fun doing it. If that sounds like your sort of place, we’d love to hear more from you.
